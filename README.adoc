= SerialTUI

== What it is

Welcome to my SerialTUI project! As the name suggests it is a crate that let you easily manage a device connected to a serial port.

== How can you use it

Just import it in your project and define your commands and connection. After that ask for a Shell and launch it. That's it. The library will manage all the boring parts while you can concentrate on writing what you need.
